# Welcome {-}

#### This site is a guide to the Google Earth Engine implementation of the LandTrendr spectral-temporal segmentation algorimth. {-}

*Please note that the provided example scripts are currently calling a non-public LT-GEE function, which is inaccessible without proper permission, so the scripts will fail if you try them now. Once the algorithm is publicly released you should have success.*

#### [Jump right in](./ui-applications.html) - plot a segmented time series or map disturbance with a GUI! {-}




***Some sections are still under construction (6/8/18) - check back frequenty in the coming month for additional UI applications and shortcut functions.
