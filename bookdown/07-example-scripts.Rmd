# Example Scripts {#example-scripts}


Three use case examples are provided, each of them begins with the same process of parameter definition and collection building and then varies on what is done with the results from the LT-GEE call. Keep in mind that these are simple building blocks to learn from. The parameter settings, methods for building collections, and the way we handle outputs in these examples are not intended to be standard protocol. We hope that the GEE community will help us develop better scripts and push what we can learn about our dynamic Earth using the LT-GEE tool.

Note that the majority of the lines included in these scripts for collection building and manipulating outputs can be reduced to a single shortcut function - see them [here](./shortcut-functions.html).

## Exploration and parameterization

LandTrendr can be run in point mode to visualize the segmentation for a pixel. 
This is really useful for quickly testing the performance of various parameter 
settings and spectral indices, as well as simply viewing and interpreting change 
in the x-y space of time and spectral value for both the source and LandTrendr 
trajectory-fitted data. We recommend starting here to understand how best to set parameters for your mapping project.

## Data generation

LandTrendr can be run in a data generation mode where every pixel time series 
within the bounds of a given region is segmented and a data cube containing 
the segmented line structure and trajectory-fitted time series stack is returned. 
The results are the basic building blocks for historical landscape state and change mapping. Before generating data cubes, it is best to explore and parameterize LT-GEE using the 1st example script.

## Change mapping

Change events can be extracted and mapped from LandTrendr's segmented line vertices. 
Information regarding the year of change event detection, magnitude of change, duration 
of change, and pre-change event spectral data can all be mapped. In this example we take the data cube generated in the previous example and extract the greatest disturbance per pixel in a region.
