**LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) 
implementation in the Google Earth Engine platform**

## Introduction

LandTrendr is set of spectral-temporal segmentation algorithms that are useful 
for change detection in a time series of moderate resolution satellite imagery (primarily Landsat) 
and for generating trajectory-based spectral time series data largely absent of 
inter-annual signal noise. LandTrendr was originally implemented in IDL 
(Interactive Data Language), but with the help of engineers at Google, it has 
been ported to the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform 
([overview](https://earthengine.google.com/), [paper](https://github.com/eMapR/LT-GEE/blob/master/docs/gorelick_etal_2017_google_earth_engine.pdf)). 
The GEE framework nearly eliminates the onerous data management and image-preprocessing 
aspects of the IDL implementation. It is also light-years faster than the IDL 
implementation, where computing time is measured in minutes instead of days.

This guide is intended to introduce the basics of running LandTrendr in GEE. 
It walks though parameters definitions, building an image collection, and 
formatting the outputs for three use cases. It is assumed that you have a 
[GEE account](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/), that you are 
somewhat familiar with the [GEE JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/), 
and have a basic understanding of LandTrendr 
([method](https://github.com/eMapR/LT-GEE/blob/master/docs/kennedy_etal_2010_landtrendr.pdf), 
[application](https://github.com/eMapR/LT-GEE/blob/master/docs/kennedy_etal_2012_disturbance_nwfp.pdf)).

## LandTrendr

Each pixel in an image time series
stack has a story to tell. For example, the following pixel (Fig 1) hails from a conifer-dominated,
industrial forest region of the Pacific Northwest (USA), its address is Lon: -123.845, Lat: 45.889. At the
beginning of its record, it was a mature, second-growth conifer stand, and for 17 years little changed.
Then, between the summers of 2000 and 2001 a service road was built through it, removing some of its vegetation. 
Over the next year it experienced a clearcut harvest, removing all of its remaining
vegetation. For the last 14 years it has been regenerating. Most
recently it was a closed canopy, maturing, conifer stand.
<br>

![pixel story](https://github.com/eMapR/LT-GEE/blob/master/imgs/pixel_story.jpg)
*Fig 1. Every pixel tells a story. Landsat provides a historical record of the character of landscapes. By
extracting a single pixel from a time series of Landsat imagery, it is possible to recount the state and change of 
the features composing the 1-hectare area of a pixel through time. In this example, we analyze the history of a conifer 
forest pixel from an industrial forest region of the Pacific Northwest (USA) that experiences a period of relative stability,
a dramatic, rapid loss of vegetation, and subsequent regeneration.*
<br>

The unabridged version of this pixel's story includes many other small changes in the forest stand it represents, but given 
the precision of the satellite sensor and errors in processing, these are the types of pixel history descriptions we are 
confident are represented well in the image time series. LandTrendr is a brevity algorithm that listens to the annual, 
gritty detail of a pixel's story and writes an abridged version. 

In practice, LandTrendr takes a single point-of-view from a pixel's spectral history, like a band or an index, and goes 
through a process to identify breakpoints or durable changes in spectral trajectory, and records the year that changes 
occurred. These breakpoints, defined by year and spectral index value, allow us to represent the spectral history of a 
pixel as a series of vertices bounding line segments (Fig 2). 
<br>

![segmentation](https://github.com/eMapR/LT-GEE/blob/master/imgs/segmentation.png)
*Fig 2. LandTrendr pixel time series segmentation. Image data is reduced to a single band or spectral index and then 
divided into a series of straight line segments by breakpoint (vertex) identification.*
<br>

There are two neat features that result from this line segment world view of spectral history.

1. The ability to interpolate new values for years between vertices.
2. Simple geometry calculations on line segments provide information about distinct epochs

The ability to interpolate new values for years between vertices is very useful. It ensures that each observation is aligned 
to a trajectory consistent with where the pixel has been and where it is going. We can think of this as hindsight-enhanced image 
time series data. It has two practical utilities. It can fill in data from missing observations in the time series (masked because 
of cloud or shadow) and it maintains consistency in predictive mapping through time; e.g. an annual forest classification is not 
likely to bounce between mature and old-growth conifer because of minor differences in spectral reflectance from atmosphere or 
shadow difference (Fig 3).
<br>

![seg index ftv](https://github.com/eMapR/LT-GEE/blob/master/imgs/seg_index_ftv.png)
*Fig 3. Hindsight-enhanced image time series data. Identification of time series breakpoints or vertices, allows the observations 
between vertices to be interpolated, removing extraneous information and placing each observation in the context of the trajectory 
it is part of. This is useful in filling missing observations because of cloud and shadow, and makes for more consistent annual 
map prediction.*
<br>

Since breakpoints or vertices are defined by a year we also have the ability to impose breakpoints identified in one spectral band 
or index on any other. For instance, we can segment a pixel time series cast as Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR: [NIR-SWIR]/[NIR+SWIR]) 
to identify vertices, and then segment a short wave infrared (SWIR) band based on the NBR-identified vertices (Fig 4).  
<br>

![other index ftv](https://github.com/eMapR/LT-GEE/blob/master/imgs/other_index_ftv.png)
*Fig 4. Impose the segmentation structure of one spectral representation on another. Here we have identified four breakpoints or 
vertices for a pixel time series using NBR, and then used the year of those vertices to segment and interpolate the values of a 
SWIR band time series for the same pixel.*
<br>

This is useful because we can make the whole data space for a pixelâ€™s time series consistent relative to a single perspective (Fig 5). 
This is limiting in that each spectral representation cannot speak for itself with regard to placement of breakpoints, but it is also 
very powerful, because we can summarize starting, ending, and delta values for all spectral representations for the same temporal segments, 
which is useful in predictive mapping of cover, agent of change, and state transitions.
<br>

![all index ftv](https://github.com/eMapR/LT-GEE/blob/master/imgs/all_index_ftv.png)
*Fig 5. A stack of spectral representations can be standardized to the segmentation structure of a single spectral band or index. Here 
we are demonstrating the standardization of tasseled cap brightness, greenness, and wetness to the segmentation structure of NBR. 
This allows us to take advantage of multiple dimension spectral space to describe the properties of spectral epochs and breakpoints 
to predict land cover, change process, and transitions from a consistent perspective (NBR).*

The three use case examples described include:

**1. Exploration and parameterization**

LandTrendr can be run in point mode to visualize the segmentation for a pixel. 
This is really useful for quickly testing the performance of various parameter 
settings and spectral indices, as well as simply viewing and interpreting change 
in the x-y space of time and spectral value for both the source and LandTrendr 
trajectory-fitted data.

**2. Data generation**

LandTrendr can be run in a data generation mode where every pixel time series 
within the bounds of a given region is segmented and a data cube containing 
the segmented line structure and trajectory-fitted time series stack is returned. 
The results are the basic building blocks for historical landscape state and change mapping.

**3. Change mapping**

Change events can be extracted and mapped from LandTrendr's segmented line vertices. 
Information regarding the year of change event detection, magnitude of change, duration 
of change, and pre-change event spectral data can all be mapped.

### Argument definitions


Each of these use cases begins with the same process of parameter definition and collection building.

***timeSeries (ImageCollection):***

Collection from which to extract trends (it's assumed that each image in the collection represents one year). The first band is used to find breakpoints, and all subsequent bands are fitted using those breakpoints.

***maxSegments (Integer):***

Maximum number of segments to be fitted on the time series.

***spikeThreshold (Float, default: 0.9):***

Threshold for dampening the spikes (1.0 means no dampening).

***vertexCountOvershoot (Integer, default: 3):***

The inital model can overshoot the maxSegments + 1 vertices by this amount. Later, it will be prunned down to maxSegments + 1.

***preventOneYearRecovery (Boolean, default: false):***

Prevent segments that represent one year recoveries.

***recoveryThreshold (Float, default: 0.25):***

If a segment has a recovery rate faster than 1/recoveryThreshold (in years), then the segment is disallowed.

***pvalThreshold (Float, default: 0.1):***

If the p-value of the fitted model exceeds this threshold, then the current model is discarded and another one is fitted using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer.

***bestModelProportion (Float, default: 1.25):***

Takes the model with most vertices that has a p-value that is at most this proportion away from the model with lowest p-value.

***minObservationsNeeded (Integer, default: 6):***

Min observations needed to perform output fitting.
