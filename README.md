# **LT-GEE**

**LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) 
implementation in the Google Earth Engine platform**
<br>

### *** We apologize for the delay in the public release of the LT-GEE algorithm - we are waiting on the GEE engineering team to push it - unfortunately they are preparing for the [Google Earth Engine User Summit](https://events.withgoogle.com/google-earth-engine-user-summit-2017/) so it may take some more time :snail: :watch: :unamused: (6/5/18)***

### Please see [Documentation](https://emapr.github.io/LT-GEE/) page for more information
