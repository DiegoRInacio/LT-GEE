**LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) 
implementation in the Google Earth Engine platform**

## Introduction

LandTrendr is set of spectral-temporal segmentation algorithms that are useful 
for change detection in a time series of moderate resolution satellite imagery (primarily Landsat) 
and for generating trajectory-based spectral time series data largely absent of 
inter-annual signal noise. LandTrendr was originally implemented in IDL 
(Interactive Data Language), but with the help of engineers at Google, it has 
been ported to the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform 
([overview](https://earthengine.google.com/), [paper](https://github.com/eMapR/LT-GEE/blob/master/docs/gorelick_etal_2017_google_earth_engine.pdf)). 
The GEE framework nearly eliminates the onerous data management and image-preprocessing 
aspects of the IDL implementation. It is also light-years faster than the IDL 
implementation, where computing time is measured in minutes instead of days.

This guide is intended to introduce the basics of running LandTrendr in GEE. 
It walks though parameters definitions, building an image collection, and 
formatting the outputs for three use cases. It is assumed that you have a 
[GEE account](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/), that you are 
somewhat familiar with the [GEE JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/), 
and have a basic understanding of LandTrendr 
([method](https://github.com/eMapR/LT-GEE/blob/master/docs/kennedy_etal_2010_landtrendr.pdf), 
[application](https://github.com/eMapR/LT-GEE/blob/master/docs/kennedy_etal_2012_disturbance_nwfp.pdf)).

## LandTrendr

A time series of satellite imagery is composed of repeated observations of spectral reflectance
for the same spatial units through time. Changes in the nature of the landscape through
time are recorded in the imagery as changes in reflectance. Each pixel in an image time series
stack has a story to tell. For example, the following pixel hails from a conifer-dominated,
industrial forest region of the Pacific northwest, its address is (-123.845, 45.889). At the
beginning of the record it was a mature second growth conifer stand, and for 17 years little changed.
Then, between the summers of 2000 and 2001 a forest road was built through it, removing some of its 
vegetation. The following year it experienced a clear-cut harvest, which removed all of its remaining
vegetation. Over the next 14 years, until the most recent observation, it has been regenerating. Most
recently it is closed canopy, maturing conifer forest stand.

LandTrendr is interested inperforms hind-sight enhanced image processing and analysis
LandTrendr segments pixel times series data to reveal the underlying properties of its source. It eliminates 
noise and extraneous information, and places each observation in the context of a cardinal linear spectral-temporal trajectory.
The resulting segements suscinctly capture the spectral history of a pixel through coordinates of
vertices in the time and spectral axes of the series. 

*put an image here*





We can think of this as hind-sight enhanced 
image processing and analysis. By looking at the entire spectral history of a pixel we can identify 
the most dominate, important change events and simply interpolate what happened in between. It allows 
use to distill state and change information relative to the significant events.  





The three use case examples described include:

**1. Exploration and parameterization**

LandTrendr can be run in point mode to visualize the segmentation for a pixel. 
This is really useful for quickly testing the performance of various parameter 
settings and spectral indices, as well as simply viewing and interpreting change 
in the x-y space of time and spectral value for both the source and LandTrendr 
trajectory-fitted data.

**2. Data generation**

LandTrendr can be run in a data generation mode where every pixel time series 
within the bounds of a given region is segmented and a data cube containing 
the segmented line structure and trajectory-fitted time series stack is returned. 
The results are the basic building blocks for historical landscape state and change mapping.

**3. Change mapping**

Change events can be extracted and mapped from LandTrendr's segmented line vertices. 
Information regarding the year of change event detection, magnitude of change, duration 
of change, and pre-change event spectral data can all be mapped.

### Argument definitions


Each of these use cases begins with the same process of parameter definition and collection building.

***timeSeries (ImageCollection):***

Collection from which to extract trends (it's assumed that each image in the collection represents one year). The first band is used to find breakpoints, and all subsequent bands are fitted using those breakpoints.

***maxSegments (Integer):***

Maximum number of segments to be fitted on the time series.

***spikeThreshold (Float, default: 0.9):***

Threshold for dampening the spikes (1.0 means no dampening).

***vertexCountOvershoot (Integer, default: 3):***

The inital model can overshoot the maxSegments + 1 vertices by this amount. Later, it will be prunned down to maxSegments + 1.

***preventOneYearRecovery (Boolean, default: false):***

Prevent segments that represent one year recoveries.

***recoveryThreshold (Float, default: 0.25):***

If a segment has a recovery rate faster than 1/recoveryThreshold (in years), then the segment is disallowed.

***pvalThreshold (Float, default: 0.1):***

If the p-value of the fitted model exceeds this threshold, then the current model is discarded and another one is fitted using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer.

***bestModelProportion (Float, default: 1.25):***

Takes the model with most vertices that has a p-value that is at most this proportion away from the model with lowest p-value.

***minObservationsNeeded (Integer, default: 6):***

Min observations needed to perform output fitting.
