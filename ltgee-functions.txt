harmonizationRoy() -- This function takes a single input, an OLI (Landsat 8) GEE image with a subset of bands, and
harmonizes the bands to ETM+ (Landsat 7). This is done using slope and intercept regression coefficients as per
Roy, D.P. Characterization of Landsat-7 to Landsat-8 reflective wavelength and normalized difference vegetation 
index continuity, Remote Sensing of Environment. The harmonization is done over OLI bands: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, 
which are renamed to ETM+ bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. The bands are then resample bicublicly then transformed with
the regression coefficients in calculation: multiply the y-intercept bands by 10000 to match the scale of the L7 
bands then apply the line equation - subtract the intercept and divide by the slope. Next the output 
system:time_start is set to the input image time_start otherwise the time metadata is null. Lastly, the image is
cast to a short data type to match format and returned from the function as a image.
 
filterCollection() -- This function takes 5 parameters: year, startDay, endDay, sensor, aoi. The first four are 
string and the last is a GEE geometry or GEE feature collection. The year , in a four digit format example '2001',
pertains to the pyiscal year in which to gather imagery. The startDay and endDay with a format of month-day 
('08-15') furthere filter the images in the spesified year. The sensor parameter pick with Landsat platform to pool
images from. The format string for a sensor is as follows: Landsat5 - 'LT05' ,Landsat7 - 'LE07',Landsat8 - 'LC08'.
Parameter 'aoi' refers to a geometryor feature collection which is the location on which to garther images.
This function will return an image collection of images for a define sensor, time and location.

removImages() -- 
  
buildSensorYearCollection() -- This function takes multipule inputs to return an image collection for a given date 
in a single year. These inputs are (year, startDay, endDay, sensor, aoi, exclude) and they are all of what they 
sound. The 'year' on which to garther images, along with the startDay and endDay dates in a format of "08-05" 
for the 5th of Augest. The sensor parameter pick with Landsat platform to pool images from. The format string for 
a sensor is as follows: Landsat5 - 'LT05' ,Landsat7 - 'LE07',Landsat8 - 'LC08'. Parameter 'aoi' refers to a geometry
or feature collection which is the location on which to garther images. the last parameter 'exclude' is a list of 
Landsat images that will be remove from the image collection. This function also accounts for date times that 
incorpate a time frame from the end of one year and into a new. This function has two helper function: removeImages()
and filterCollection()

getSRcollection() -- This function gathers images for a time window less than or equal to a year. Then using 
harmoniztionRoy() harmonizes any Landsat8 images to Landsat7, and then tries to mask out any of the following image
contamiates (cloud, snow, shadow and water).Lastly returning a clearer more homogenuous image collection for a 
sensor. The inputs are (year, startDay, endDay, sensor, aoi, maskThese, exclude) and they are all of what they sound.
The 'year'on which to garther images, along with the startDay and endDay dates in a format of "08-05" for the 5th 
of Augest. The sensor parameter pick with Landsat platform to pool images from. The format string for a sensor is as 
follows: Landsat5 - 'LT05' ,Landsat7 - 'LE07',Landsat8 - 'LC08'. Parameter 'aoi' refers to a geometry or feature 
collection which is the location on which to garther images. The input maskThese is a list of image masking options
that are defined as ['cloud', 'shadow', 'snow', 'water']. The last parameter 'exclude' is a list of Landsat images 
that will be remove from the image collection. This function in includes other function: harmonizationRoy(), 
filterCollection(), and buildSensorYearCollection().

getCombinedSRcollection() -- This function brings all the image collection together from different sensors for given
date time with in a year and merges them together. It does this by running getSRcollection() for each sensor, thus 
the parameter inputs for this fuction are the same as getSRcollection() EXCEPT for the input parameter sensor. Which
is not a parameter for this functnion. The inputs are (year, startDay, endDay, aoi, maskThese, exclude) and they are all of what they sound.
The 'year'on which to garther images, along with the startDay and endDay dates in a format of "08-05" for the 5th    
of Augest. The sensor parameter pick with Landsat platform to pool images from. Parameter 'aoi' refers to a geometry or feature     
collection which is the location on which to garther images. The input maskThese is a list of image masking options  
that are defined as ['cloud', 'shadow', 'snow', 'water']. The last parameter 'exclude' is a list of Landsat images   
that will be remove from the image collection. 

medoidMosaic() -- This function generates a medoid composite from an image collection and a blank image collection 
(the blank image collection is used to fill no data years). Medoids are representative objects of a data set or a 
cluster with a data set whose average dissimilarity to all the objects in the cluster is minimal. Medoids are 
similar in concept to means or centroids, but medoids are always members of the data set. This function takes two 
input parameters a image collection and a dummy or blank image collection and returns a medoid composite image.

buildMosaic() -- This function applies the medoid compositing meathod to an image collection. It does so by using 
the getComninedSRcollection() and medoidMosaic(), and returns a medoid image composite for a single year. Since this
functions uses two other functions the parameters include all the paramter from the other two functions. 


buildSRcollection() -- This function brings all the above function together.
